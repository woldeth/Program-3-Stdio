ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
FRANCISC1O at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO 
BERNARDO 
Who's there?
FRANCISCO 
Nay, answer me: stand, a1nd unfold yourself.
BERNARDO 
Long live the king!
FRANCISCO 
Bernardo?
BERNARDO 
He.
FRANCISC1O 
You come most carefully upon your hour.
BERNARDO 
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Fra1ncisco.
FRANCISCO 
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
BERNAR1DO 
Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO 
Not a mouse stirring.
BERNARDO 
Well, good night.
If 1you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRANCISCO 
I thin1k I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
HORATIO 
Friends to this groun1d.
MARCELLUS 
And liegemen to the Dane.
FRANCISCO 
Give you good night.
MARCELLUS 
O, farewell1, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?
FRANCISCO 
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.1
Exit
MARCELLUS 
Holla! Bernardo!
BERNARDO 
Say,
What, is Horatio there?
HORATIO 
A piece of 1him.
BERNARDO 
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
MARCELLUS 
What, has this thing appear1'd again to-night?
BERNARDO 
I have seen nothing.
MARCELLUS 
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,1
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore1 I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparit1ion come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
HORATIO 
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
BERNA1RDO 
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our s1tory
What we have two nights seen.
HORATIO 
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of1 this.
BERNARDO 
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made h1is course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then be1ating one,--
Enter Ghost
MARCELLUS 
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
BERNARDO 1
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
MARCELLUS 
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horat1io.
BERNARDO 
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
HORATIO 
Most like: it harrows me wi1th fear and wonder.
BERNARDO 
It would be spoke to.
MARCELLUS 
Question it, Horatio.
HORATIO 
1What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which 1the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
MARCELLUS 
It 1is offended.
BERNARDO 
See, it stalks away!
HORATIO 
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
1Exit Ghost
MARCELLUS 
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
BERNARDO 
How now, Horatio! you tremble an1d look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
HORATIO 
Before my Go1d, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
MARCELLUS 
Is1 it not like the king?
HORATIO 
As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When 1he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledde1d Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
MARCELLUS 
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Wi1th martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
HORATIO 
In what particular thought to work I know not1;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
MARCEL1LUS 
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch1
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign 1mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the S1unday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labour1er with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?
HORATIO 
That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so1. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norwa1y,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--1
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compa1ct,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he s1tood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; whi1ch had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant1,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimpr1oved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless1 resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
A1s it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory1, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our prepa1rations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land1.
BERNARDO 
I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Com1es armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.
HORATIO 1
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere th1e mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in1 the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the 1moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:1
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue1 to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countr1ymen.--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Re-enter Ghost
I'll cross it, though it blast1 me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good t1hing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
Cock crows
If thou art p1rivy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoa1rded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk1 in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
MARCELLUS 
Shall I strike at it with1 my partisan?
HORATIO 
Do, if it will not stand.
BERNARDO 
'Tis here!
HORATIO 
'Tis here!
MAR1CELLUS 
'Tis gone!
Exit Ghost
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of viole1nce;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
BERNARDO 
It was1 about to speak, when the cock crew.
HORATIO 
And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fear1ful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shri1ll-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or 1air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present 1object made probation.
MARCELLUS 
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst1 that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all nigh1t long:
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets1 strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
1HORATIO 
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
W1alks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impar1t what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will s1peak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our du2ty?
MARCELLUS 
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most cg our du3onveniently.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE,1 HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants 
KING CLAUDIUS 
Though yet1 of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our heart1s in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion f1ought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.1
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have1 we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral1 and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Taken to wife: nor have w1e herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our t1hanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thi1nking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with 1the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender 1of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for1 him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
1To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his neph1ew's purpose,--to suppress
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists and full proport1ions, are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltiman1d,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To busines1s with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste1 commend your duty.
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND 
In that and all things will we show our duty.
KING CLAUD1IUS 
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
And now, Laertes, wha1t's the news with you?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to1 the Dane,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not t1hy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Tha1n is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
LAERTES 
My dread lord1,
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
To s1how my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes be1nd again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Have you yo1ur father's leave? What says Polonius?
LORD POLONIUS 
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leav1e
By laboursome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
I do beseech you, g1ive him leave to go.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
And thy best grac1es spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
HAMLET 
[Aside] A little more t1han kin, and less than kind.
KING CLAUDIUS 
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
HAMLET 1
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour o1ff,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek fo1r thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through1 nature to eternity.
HAMLET 
Ay, madam, it is common.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
If it be,
Why seems it so1 particular with thee?
HAMLET 
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone my ink1y cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,1
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Together with all1 forms, moods, shapes of grief,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
For they are actions 1that a man might play:
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the 1suits of woe.
KING CLAUDIUS 
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mou1rning duties to your father:
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost1 his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow: but to pe1rsever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
It shows1 a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple a1nd unschool'd:
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
W1hy should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
A fault agai1nst the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Is death of fathers, an1d who still hath cried,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
'This must be so.' We pray 1you, throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take 1note,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which1 dearest father bears his son,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in 1Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here, in 1the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Let1 not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
HAMLET 1
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Be 1as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my h1eart: in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
But the great cannon to the c1louds shall tell,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. C1ome away.
Exeunt all but HAMLET
HAMLET 
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Thaw and res1olve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O 1God! God!
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on'1t! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it1 merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
So excellent1 a king; that was, to this,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem t1he winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? why, she would h1ang on him,
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Let1 me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With1 which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
O, God! a b1east, that wants discourse of reason,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
My father'1s brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Ere yet the salt of most1 unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to1 post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
But break, 1my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO
HORATIO 
Hail to your1 lordship!
HAMLET 
I am glad to see you well:
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
HORATIO 
The sam1e, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
HAMLET 
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with yo1u:
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
MARCELLUS 
My good lord--
HAMLET 
I a1m very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
HORATIO 
A 1truant disposition, good my lord.
HAMLET 
I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do mi2ne ear that violence,
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself: I know you aou do mi3re no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
1HORATIO 
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
HAMLET 
I pray thee, do not mock me, fello1w-student;
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
HORATIO 
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard 1upon.
HAMLET 
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marri1age tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My fat1her!--methinks I see my father.
HORATIO 
Where, my lord?
HAMLET 
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
HOR1ATIO 
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
HAMLET 
He was a man, take him for all in all,
I sha1ll not look upon his like again.
HORATIO 
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
HAMLET 
Saw? w1ho?
HORATIO 
My lord, the king your father.
HAMLET 
The king my father!
HORATIO 
Season your a1dmiration for awhile
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,1
This marvel to you.
HAMLET 
For God's love, let me hear.
HORATIO 
Two nights together had these1 gentlemen,
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Bee1n thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Appears before th1em, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
By their oppress'd and f1ear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the1 act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
An1d I with them the third night kept the watch;
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Form of 1the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
These hands are1 not more like.
HAMLET 
But where was this?
MARCELLUS 
My lord, upon the platform where we watch1'd.
HAMLET 
Did you not speak to it?
HORATIO 
My lord, I did;
But answer made it none: yet once1 methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But ev1en then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish'd from ou1r sight.
HAMLET 
'Tis very strange.
HORATIO 
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
And we 1did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.
HAMLET 
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this 1troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO 
We do, my lord.
HAMLET 
Arm'd, sa1y you?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO 
Arm'd, my lord.
HAMLET 
From top to toe?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO 
My lor1d, from head to foot.
HAMLET 
Then saw you not his face?
HORATIO 
O, yes, my lord; he wore his b1eaver up.
HAMLET 
What, look'd he frowningly?
HORATIO 
A countenance more in sorrow than in ange1r.
HAMLET 
Pale or red?
HORATIO 
Nay, very pale.
HAMLET 
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
HORATIO1 
Most constantly.
HAMLET 
I would I had been there.
HORATIO 
It would have much amazed you.
H1AMLET 
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
HORATIO 
While one with moderate haste might tell a 1hundred.
MARCELLUS BERNARDO 
Longer, longer.
HORATIO 
Not when I saw't.
HAMLET 
His beard was 1grizzled--no?
HORATIO 
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.
HAMLET 
I will 1watch to-night;
Perchance 'twill walk again.
HORATIO 
I warrant it will.
HAMLET 
If it assume m1y noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace1. I pray you all,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Let it be tenable in your silence sti1ll;
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
I will requi1te your loves. So, fare you well:
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
I'll visit you.
Al1l 
Our duty to your honour.
HAMLET 
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
Exeunt all but HAMLET1
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
T1ill then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's ey1es.
Exit
SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA 
LAERTES 
My necessari1es are embark'd: farewell:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not 1sleep,
But let me hear from you.
OPHELIA 
Do you doubt that?
LAERTES 
For Hamlet and the trifli1ng of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Fo1rward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
OPHELIA1 
No more but so?
LAERTES 
Think it no more;
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
In thews1 and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. P1erhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will: but you 1must fear,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth:1
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The safety and 1health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yiel1ding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far1 to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further1
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If wit1h too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unma1ster'd importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your af1fection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
If she unmas1k her beauty to the moon:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infan1ts of the spring,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
And in the morn and liquid dew of you1th
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itse1lf rebels, though none else near.
OPHELIA 
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
As watchm1an to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and1 thorny way to heaven;
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of 1dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede.
LAERTES 
O, fear me not.
I stay too long: but here1 my father comes.
Enter POLONIUS
A double blessing is a double grace,
Occasion smiles upon a seco1nd leave.
LORD POLONIUS 
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoul1der of your sail,
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in 1thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act1.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Gr1apple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each ne1w-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Bear't that the oppos1ed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man's censure, but res1erve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not ga1udy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are o1f a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses1 both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine ownse1lf be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Fa1rewell: my blessing season this in thee!
LAERTES 
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
LORD P1OLONIUS 
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
LAERTES 
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember w1ell
What I have said to you.
OPHELIA 
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
And you yourself shall keep the 2key of it.
LAERTES 
Farewell.
Exit
LORD POLONIUS 
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to yeep the 3ou?
OPHELIA 
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
LORD POLONIUS 
Marry, well betho1ught:
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Have of 1your audience been most free and bounteous:
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
And that in way of 1caution, I must tell you,
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behoves my daughter and 1your honour.
What is between you? give me up the truth.
OPHELIA 
He hath, my lord, of late made m1any tenders
Of his affection to me.
LORD POLONIUS 
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,1
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
OPHELIA 
I1 do not know, my lord, what I should think.
LORD POLONIUS 
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a1 baby;
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself mor1e dearly;
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.1
OPHELIA 
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
In honourable fashion.
LORD POLONIUS 
Ay, fas1hion you may call it; go to, go to.
OPHELIA 
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
W1ith almost all the holy vows of heaven.
LORD POLONIUS 
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,1
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Givin1g more light than heat, extinct in both,
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
You must not ta1ke for fire. From this time
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Set your entreatments at 1a higher rate
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Believe so much in him, that he is young1
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Do not believe his v1ows; for they are brokers,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
But mere implorators of u1nholy suits,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
I1 would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
As to gi1ve words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
OPHELIA 
I shall 1obey, my lord.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The platform.
Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS 
HAMLET 
The1 air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
HORATIO 
It is a nipping and an eager air.
HAMLET 
What ho1ur now?
HORATIO 
I think it lacks of twelve.
HAMLET 
No, it is struck.
HORATIO 
Indeed? I hear1d it not: then it draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
A flourish of tr1umpets, and ordnance shot off, within
What does this mean, my lord?
HAMLET 
The king doth wake to1-night and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
And, as he drains h1is draughts of Rhenish down,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge.1
HORATIO 
Is it a custom?
HAMLET 
Ay, marry, is't:
But to my mind, though I am native here
And 1to the manner born, it is a custom
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-hea1ded revel east and west
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
They clepe us drunkards, and1 with swinish phrase
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
From our achievements, though perform'1d at height,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
So, oft it chances in particular men,
That for1 some vicious mole of nature in them,
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
Since natur1e cannot choose his origin--
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
Oft breaking down the pales and1 forts of reason,
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
The form of plausive manners, that t1hese men,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
T1heir virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may undergo--
Shall in the general1 censure take corruption
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance1 of a doubt
To his own scandal.
HORATIO 
Look, my lord, it comes!
Enter Ghost
HAMLET 
Angels a1nd ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Bring with thee airs1 from heaven or blasts from hell,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou comest in such a quest1ionable shape
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane: O, answe1r me!
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Have bur1st their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Hath oped his ponderou1s and marble jaws,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again in comp1lete steel
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature1
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is t1his? wherefore? what should we do?
Ghost beckons HAMLET
HORATIO 
It beckons you to go away with i1t,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.
MARCELLUS 
Look, with what courteous action1
It waves you to a more removed ground:
But do not go with it.
HORATIO 
No, by no means.
HAMLET1 
It will not speak; then I will follow it.
HORATIO 
Do not, my lord.
HAMLET 
Why, what should 1be the fear?
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being 1a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
HORATIO 
What if it tempt yo1u toward the flood, my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles o'er his base int1o the sea,
And there assume some other horrible form,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reas1on
And draw you into madness? think of it:
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Without more 1motive, into every brain
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath.
HAMLET 1
It waves me still.
Go on; I'll follow thee.
MARCELLUS 
You shall not go, my lord.
HAMLET 
Hol1d off your hands.
HORATIO 
Be ruled; you shall not go.
HAMLET 
My fate cries out,
And makes eac1h petty artery in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gen1tlemen.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
E1xeunt Ghost and HAMLET
HORATIO 
He waxes desperate with imagination.
MARCELLUS 
Let's follow; 't1is not fit thus to obey him.
HORATIO 
Have after. To what issue will this come?
MARCELLUS 
Somet1hing is rotten in the state of Denmark.
HORATIO 
Heaven will direct it.
MARCELLUS 
Nay, let's fo1llow him.
Exeunt
SCENE V. Another part of the platform.
Enter GHOST and HAMLET 
HAMLET 
Where w1ilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
Ghost 
Mark me.
HAMLET 
I will.
Ghost 
My hour is1 almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.
HAMLET 
Alas, po1or ghost!
Ghost 
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.
HAMLET 
Spea1k; I am bound to hear.
Ghost 
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
HAMLET 
What?
Ghost1 
I am thy father's spirit,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined1 to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But t1hat I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word1
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their 1spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand on end,
Like qu1ills upon the fretful porpentine:
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. 1List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
HAMLET 
O God!
Ghost 
Revenge hi1s foul and most unnatural murder.
HAMLET 
Murder!
Ghost 
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;1
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
HAMLET 
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swi1ft
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
May sweep to my revenge.
Ghost 
I find thee apt;
And 2duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Wouldst;
And 3t thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent1 stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused: but know,1 thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown.
HAMLET 
O m1y prophetic soul! My uncle!
Ghost 
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of1 his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!--won 1to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was 1there!
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made1 to her in marriage, and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!1
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, th1ough to a radiant angel link'd,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
And prey on garbage.
But, so1ft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
My custom alway1s of the afternoon,
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
1And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity 1with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the1 body,
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin an1d wholesome blood: so did it mine;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
Most lazar-like, with v1ile and loathsome crust,
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, o1f crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhousel'd, disappo1inted, unanel'd,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head:
1O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
Let not the roy1al bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,1
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
And t1o those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
The glow-w1orm shows the matin to be near,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, reme1mber me.
Exit
HAMLET 
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
And shall I couple hell? O, 1fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me stiffly up. Remem1ber thee!
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!1
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all 1forms, all pressures past,
That youth and observation copied there;
And thy commandment all alone 1shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
O m1ost pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables,--meet it is I set it1 down,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:1
Writing
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
I have swo1rn 't.
MARCELLUS HORATIO 
[Within] My lord, my lord,--
MARCELLUS 
[Within] Lord Hamlet,--
HORAT1IO 
[Within] Heaven secure him!
HAMLET 
So be it!
HORATIO 
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
HA1MLET 
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
MARCELLUS 
How is't, my 1noble lord?
HORATIO 
What news, my lord?
HAMLET 
O, wonderful!
HORATIO 
Good my lord, tell it.1
HAMLET 
No; you'll reveal it.
HORATIO 
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
MARCELLUS 
Nor I, my lord.1
HAMLET 
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?
HORATIO MARCE1LLUS 
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
HAMLET 
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he's a1n arrant knave.
HORATIO 
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
To tell us this.
HAM1LET 
Why, right; you are i' the right;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
I hold it fit th1at we shake hands and part:
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
For every man has bu1siness and desire,
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Look you, I'll go pray.
HORATIO 
T1hese are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
HAMLET 
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Yes, 1'faith heartily.
HORATIO 
There's no offence, my lord.
HAMLET 
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there 1is, Horatio,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
It is an honest ghost, that let me t1ell you:
For your desire to know what is between us,
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good frien1ds,
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
Give me one poor request.
HORATIO 
What is't, my 1lord? we will.
HAMLET 
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
HORATIO MARCELLUS 
My lord,1 we will not.
HAMLET 
Nay, but swear't.
HORATIO 
In faith,
My lord, not I.
MARCELLUS 
Nor I, 1my lord, in faith.
HAMLET 
Upon my sword.
MARCELLUS 
We have sworn, my lord, already.
HAMLET 
1Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Ghost 
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET 
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art 1thou there,
truepenny?
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
Consent to swear.
HORATI1O 
Propose the oath, my lord.
HAMLET 
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Swear by my swo1rd.
Ghost 
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET 
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, ge1ntlemen,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Swea1r by my sword.
Ghost 
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET 
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so f1ast?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
HORATIO 
O day and night, but this is wondr1ous strange!
HAMLET 
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven1 and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
Here, as before, never, so h1elp you mercy,
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet1
To put an antic disposition on,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
With arms encumbe1r'd thus, or this headshake,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
As 'Well, well, we know,' 1or 'We could, an if we would,'
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
Or such 1ambiguous giving out, to note
That you know aught of me: this not to do,
So grace and mercy at you1r most need help you, Swear.
Ghost 
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET 
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
They1 swear
So, gentlemen,
With all my love I do commend me to you:
And what so poor a man as Hamlet i1s
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in toge1ther;
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
That1 ever I was born to set it right!
Nay, come, let's go together.
Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. A room in1 POLONIUS' house.
Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO 
LORD POLONIUS 
Give him this money and these notes1, Reynaldo.
REYNALDO 
I will, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS 
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reyna1ldo,
Before you visit him, to make inquire
Of his behavior.
REYNALDO 
My lord, I did intend it.1
LORD POLONIUS 
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Inquire me first what Danskers ar1e in Paris;
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
What company, at what expense; and 1finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more nearer1
Than your particular demands will touch it:
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
1As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
REYNAL1DO 
Ay, very well, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS 
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
But, if1't be he I mean, he's very wild;
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
What forgeries you plea2se; marry, none so rank
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
But, sir, such wanton, wiyou plea3ld and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.
REYNALDO 
As gam1ing, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS 
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Drabbing: you may g1o so far.
REYNALDO 
My lord, that would dishonour him.
LORD POLONIUS 
'Faith, no; as you may sea1son it in the charge
You must not put another scandal on him,
That he is open to incontinency;
Th1at's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
1The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Of general assault.
RE1YNALDO 
But, my good lord,--
LORD POLONIUS 
Wherefore should you do this?
REYNALDO 
Ay, my lord1,
I would know that.
LORD POLONIUS 
Marry, sir, here's my drift;
And I believe, it is a fetch of1 wit:
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,1 Mark you,
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes1
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
He closes with you in this consequence;
'Good sir,' 1or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country.
R1EYNALDO 
Very good, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS 
And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
abo1ut to say? By the mass, I was about to say
something: where did I leave?
REYNALDO 
At 'closes in 1the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
and 'gentleman.'
LORD POLONIUS 
At 'closes in the consequenc1e,' ay, marry;
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
Or th1en, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
1There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
Videlicet, a b1rothel, or so forth.
See you now;
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
And thus do we1 of wisdom and of reach,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
By indirections find directions 1out:
So by my former lecture and advice,
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
REYNALDO 
1My lord, I have.
LORD POLONIUS 
God be wi' you; fare you well.
REYNALDO 
Good my lord!
LORD POL1ONIUS 
Observe his inclination in yourself.
REYNALDO 
I shall, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS 
And let 1him ply his music.
REYNALDO 
Well, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS 
Farewell!
Exit REYNALDO
Enter OPHEL1IA
How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
OPHELIA 
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!1
LORD POLONIUS 
With what, i' the name of God?
OPHELIA 
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
L1ord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
Ungarter'd,1 and down-gyved to his ancle;
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
And with a look so1 piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.1
LORD POLONIUS 
Mad for thy love?
OPHELIA 
My lord, I do not know;
But truly, I do fear it.
LO1RD POLONIUS 
What said he?
OPHELIA 
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to th1e length of all his arm;
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
He falls to such perusal of 1my face
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
At last, a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice 1his head thus waving up and down,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatt1er all his bulk
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And, with his head over his shoulder 1turn'd,
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
For out o' doors he went without their helps,1
And, to the last, bended their light on me.
LORD POLONIUS 
Come, go with me: I will go seek the k1ing.
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will t1o desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures. I am so1rry.
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
OPHELIA 
No, my good lord, but, as you did 1command,
I did repel his fetters and denied
His access to me.
LORD POLONIUS 
That hath made him 1mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifl1e,
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
To ca1st beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion. Come,1 go we to the king:
This must be known; which, being kept close, might
move
More grief to hide th1an hate to utter love.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE1, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants 
KING CLAUDIUS 
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildens1tern!
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hast1y sending. Something have you heard
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
Sith nor the exterior 1nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
More than his father's death, that th1us hath put him
So much from the understanding of himself,
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,1
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,1
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time: so by your companies
To draw hi1m on to pleasures, and to gather,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
Whether aught, to us unk1nown, afflicts him thus,
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Good gentlemen, he1 hath much talk'd of you;
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres. If i1t will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile,
1For the supply and profit of our hope,
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a king's 1remembrance.
ROSENCRANTZ 
Both your majesties
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Put 1your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty.
GUILDENSTERN 
But we both obey,
And her1e give up ourselves, in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To be commanded.
KI1NG CLAUDIUS 
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Thanks, Guildenstern an1d gentle Rosencrantz:
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son. Go, some of yo1u,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
GUILDENSTERN 
Heavens make our presence and our pra1ctises
Pleasant and helpful to him!
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Ay, amen!
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, 1and some Attendants
Enter POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS 
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Are1 joyfully return'd.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
LORD POLONIUS 
1Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
Both to my God and to 1my gracious king:
And I do think, or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure1
As it hath used to do, that I have found
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
KING CLAUDIUS 
O, s1peak of that; that do I long to hear.
LORD POLONIUS 
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
My1 news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Thyself do grace to them, and bring t1hem in.
Exit POLONIUS
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
The head and source of all you1r son's distemper.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
I doubt it is no other but the main;
His father's death, and o1ur o'erhasty marriage.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Well, we shall sift him.
Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND 1and CORNELIUS
Welcome, my good friends!
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
VOLTIMAND 1
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
His nephew's l1evies; which to him appear'd
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
But, better look'd into, he t1ruly found
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
That so his sickness, age and impotence1
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
Receives r1ebuke from Norway, and in fine
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give the assay of arms aga2inst your majesty.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Gives him three thousand crowns arms aga3in annual fee,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
So levied as before, against the Polac1k:
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
Giving a paper
That it might please you to give quiet 1pass
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
On such regards of safety and allowance
As there1in are set down.
KING CLAUDIUS 
It likes us well;
And at our more consider'd time well read,
Ans1wer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
Go to your res1t; at night we'll feast together:
Most welcome home!
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
LORD POLONIUS1 
This business is well ended.
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what d1uty is,
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day and ti1me.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,1
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
What is't bu1t to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
More matter, with less art.
LORD 1POLONIUS 
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
And1 pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
Mad let us grant h1im, then: and now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect,
Or rather say, the cause of t1his defect,
For this effect defective comes by cause:
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Per1pend.
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
Hath give1n me this: now gather, and surmise.
Reads
'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
beautifi1ed Ophelia,'--
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
a vile phrase: but you shall h1ear. Thus:
Reads
'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Came this from Haml1et to her?
LORD POLONIUS 
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
Reads
'Doubt thou the sta1rs are fire;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.
'O 1dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
I love thee 1best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
this machine is to hi1m, HAMLET.'
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
And more above, hath his solicitings,
1As they fell out by time, by means and place,
All given to mine ear.
KING CLAUDIUS 
But how hath 1she
Received his love?
LORD POLONIUS 
What do you think of me?
KING CLAUDIUS 
As of a man faith1ful and honourable.
LORD POLONIUS 
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
When I had se1en this hot love on the wing--
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
Before my daughter told me1--what might you,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
If I had play'd the desk or table-boo1k,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
What mig1ht you think? No, I went round to work,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
'Lord Hamlet is 1a prince, out of thy star;
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
That she should lock h1erself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Which done, she took the fruits of1 my advice;
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
Thenc1e to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Into the mad1ness wherein now he raves,
And all we mourn for.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Do you think 'tis this?
QUEEN GE1RTRUDE 
It may be, very likely.
LORD POLONIUS 
Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--1
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
When it proved otherwise?
KING CLAUDIUS 
Not that I know.1
LORD POLONIUS 
[Pointing to his head and shoulder]
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
If1 circumstances lead me, I will find
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the centr1e.
KING CLAUDIUS 
How may we try it further?
LORD POLONIUS 
You know, sometimes he walks four ho1urs together
Here in the lobby.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
So he does indeed.
LORD POLONIUS 
At such a tim1e I'll loose my daughter to him:
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Mark the encounter: if he love1 her not
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
Let me be no assistant for a state,
But keep 1a farm and carters.
KING CLAUDIUS 
We will try it.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
But, look, where sadly the po1or wretch comes reading.
LORD POLONIUS 
Away, I do beseech you, both away:
I'll board him present1ly.
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants
Enter HAMLET, reading
O, give me leave:1
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
HAMLET 
Well, God-a-mercy.
LORD POLONIUS 
Do you know me, my lord1?
HAMLET 
Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
LORD POLONIUS 
Not I, my lord.
HAMLET 
Then I 1would you were so honest a man.
LORD POLONIUS 
Honest, my lord!
HAMLET 
Ay, sir; to be honest, a1s this world goes, is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand.
LORD POLONIUS 
That's very true, 1my lord.
HAMLET 
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
god kissing carrion,--Have y1ou a daughter?
LORD POLONIUS 
I have, my lord.
HAMLET 
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception i1s a
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend, look to 't.
LORD POLONIUS 
[Aside] 1How say you by that? Still harping on my
daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
was a fi1shmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
love; very1 near this. I'll speak to him again.
What do you read, my lord?
HAMLET 
Words, words, words.
LOR1D POLONIUS 
What is the matter, my lord?
HAMLET 
Between who?
LORD POLONIUS 
I mean, the matter1 that you read, my lord.
HAMLET 
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
that old men ha1ve grey beards, that their faces are
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
plum-tree gum an1d that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
though I m1ost powerfully and potently believe, yet
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
yours1elf, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
you could go backward.
LORD POLONIUS 
[Aside] Tho1ugh this be madness, yet there is method
in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
HAMLET 
In1to my grave.
LORD POLONIUS 
Indeed, that is out o' the air.
Aside
How pregnant sometimes his rep1lies are! a happiness
that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
could not so prosperousl1y be delivered of. I will
leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
meeting between him and my1 daughter.--My honourable
lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
HAMLET 
You cannot, sir,1 take from me any thing that I will
more willingly part withal: except my life, except
my life, ex1cept my life.
LORD POLONIUS 
Fare you well, my lord.
HAMLET 
These tedious old fools!
Enter ROS1ENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
LORD POLONIUS 
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
ROSENCRANTZ1 
[To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!
Exit POLONIUS
GUILDENSTERN 
My honoured lord!
ROSENCRANTZ 
1My most dear lord!
HAMLET 
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrant1z! Good lads, how do ye both?
ROSENCRANTZ 
As the indifferent children of the earth.
GUILDENSTERN1 
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
HAMLET 
Nor1 the soles of her shoe?
ROSENCRANTZ 
Neither, my lord.
HAMLET 
Then you live about her waist, or1 in the middle of
her favours?
GUILDENSTERN 
'Faith, her privates we.
HAMLET 
In the secret par1ts of fortune? O, most true; she
is a strumpet. What's the news?
ROSENCRANTZ 
None, my lord, but 1that the world's grown honest.
HAMLET 
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
Let me q1uestion more in particular: what have you,
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
that1 she sends you to prison hither?
GUILDENSTERN 
Prison, my lord!
HAMLET 
Denmark's a prison.
ROS2ENCRANTZ 
Then is the world one.
HAMLET 
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,on.
ROS3
wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
ROSENCRANTZ 
We think not so, my lord.
HAMLE1T 
Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so:1 to me
it is a prison.
ROSENCRANTZ 
Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
narrow for yo1ur mind.
HAMLET 
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
myself a king of infinite spa1ce, were it not that I
have bad dreams.
GUILDENSTERN 
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the v1ery
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
HAMLET 
A dream itself is but a s1hadow.
ROSENCRANTZ 
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
quality that it is but a sh1adow's shadow.
HAMLET 
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretched heroes the 1beggars' shadows. Shall we
to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN1 
We'll wait upon you.
HAMLET 
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
of my servants,1 for, to speak to you like an honest
man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
beaten way of1 friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
ROSENCRANTZ 
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
HA1MLET 
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
thank you: and sure, dear friends, my than1ks are
too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
your own inclining? Is it a free visitat1ion? Come,
deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
GUILDENSTERN 
What should we say, my lord1?
HAMLET 
Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
for; and there is a kind of confessio1n in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
I know the good king and que1en have sent for you.
ROSENCRANTZ 
To what end, my lord?
HAMLET 
That you must teach me. But let1 me conjure you, by
the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
our youth, by the obligatio1n of our ever-preserved
love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal, be 1even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for, or no?
ROSENCRANTZ 
[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] W1hat say you?
HAMLET 
[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
love me, hold not off.
GUI1LDENSTERN 
My lord, we were sent for.
HAMLET 
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
prev1ent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
w1herefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heav1ily
with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this 1most
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof f1retted
with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregati1on of vapours.
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculty! in for1m and moving how
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
in apprehension how like a go1d! the beauty of the
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
what is this quintessence of d1ust? man delights not
me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
you seem to say so.
ROSEN1CRANTZ 
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
HAMLET 
Why did you laugh then, when I s1aid 'man delights not me'?
ROSENCRANTZ 
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
lenten1 entertainment the players shall receive from
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
c1oming, to offer you service.
HAMLET 
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
shall h1ave tribute of me; the adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
sigh 1gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
lung1s are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
f1or't. What players are they?
ROSENCRANTZ 
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
traged1ians of the city.
HAMLET 
How chances it they travel? their residence, both
in reputation and pro1fit, was better both ways.
ROSENCRANTZ 
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
late i1nnovation.
HAMLET 
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
in the city? are they so 1followed?
ROSENCRANTZ 
No, indeed, are they not.
HAMLET 
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
ROSE1NCRANTZ 
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
there is, sir, an aery of children, li1ttle eyases,
that cry out on the top of question, and are most
tyrannically clapped for't: these a1re now the
fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
call them--that many wearing rapier1s are afraid of
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
HAMLET 
What, are they children? who m1aintains 'em? how are
they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing? wil1l they not say
afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
players--as it is most like, i1f their means are no
better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
exclaim against their own s1uccession?
ROSENCRANTZ 
'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
the nation holds it 1no sin to tarre them to
controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
for argument, unless the1 poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question.
HAMLET 
Is't possible?
GUILDENSTERN 
O, the1re has been much throwing about of brains.
HAMLET 
Do the boys carry it away?
ROSENCRANTZ 
Ay, t1hat they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
HAMLET 
It is not very strange; for mine uncle is1 king of
Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
my father lived, give twenty, forty,1 fifty, an
hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
'Sblood, there is something in this m1ore than
natural, if philosophy could find it out.
Flourish of trumpets within
GUILDENSTERN 
The1re are the players.
HAMLET 
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
come then: the ap1purtenance of welcome is fashion
and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
lest my extent1 to the players, which, I tell you,
must show fairly outward, should more appear like
entertainmen1t than yours. You are welcome: but my
uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
GUILDENSTERN 
In1 what, my dear lord?
HAMLET 
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
southerly I know a h1awk from a handsaw.
Enter POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS 
Well be with you, gentlemen!
HAMLET 
Hark you1, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
out of1 his swaddling-clouts.
ROSENCRANTZ 
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
say an ol1d man is twice a child.
HAMLET 
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
mark it. You 1say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
'twas so indeed.
LORD POLONIUS 
My lord, I have news to tell y1ou.
HAMLET 
My lord, I have news to tell you.
When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
LORD POLONIUS1 
The actors are come hither, my lord.
HAMLET 
Buz, buz!
LORD POLONIUS 
Upon mine honour,--
HA1MLET 
Then came each actor on his ass,--
LORD POLONIUS 
The best actors in the world, either for 1tragedy,
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tr1agical-
comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too he1avy, nor
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
liberty, these are the only men.
HAMLET 1
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
LORD POLONIUS 
What a treasure had he, m1y lord?
HAMLET 
Why,
'One fair daughter and no more,
The which he loved passing well.'
LORD POL1ONIUS 
[Aside] Still on my daughter.
HAMLET 
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
LORD POLONIUS 1
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
that I love passing well.
HAMLET 
Nay, that1 follows not.
LORD POLONIUS 
What follows, then, my lord?
HAMLET 
Why,
'As by lot, God wot,'
a1nd then, you know,
'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
the first row of the pious chanson wi2ll show you
more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
Enter four or five Players
You aranson wi3e welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
fri1end! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young1
lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the1
altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within 1the
ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we1 see:
we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
of your quality; come, a passionate spee1ch.
First Player 
What speech, my lord?
HAMLET 
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was1
never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'tw1as
caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
it, and others, whose judgments in such matte1rs
cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
digested in the scenes, set down with as much1
modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
s1avoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation; but called it an
1honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I1
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
Pr1iam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
at this line: let me see, let me see--
'The rugg1ed Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
'The rugged Pyrr1hus, he whose sable arms,
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the 1ominous horse,
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
With heraldry more dismal; head to1 foot
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Ba1ked and impasted with the parching streets,
That lend a tyrannous and damned light
To their lord's1 murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
With eyes like carbun1cles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
So, proceed you.
LORD POLONIUS 
'Fore God,1 my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
good discretion.
First Player 
'Anon he finds him
St1riking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Repugna1nt to command: unequal match'd,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
But with the whiff 1and wind of his fell sword
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
Seeming to feel this b1low, with flaming top
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: fo1r, lo! his sword,
Which was declining on the milky head
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to st1ick:
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
And like a neutral to his will and matter,
Did nothi1ng.
But, as we often see, against some storm,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
The1 bold winds speechless and the orb below
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
Doth rend the1 region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
And never did the Cyclop1s' hammers fall
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding 1sword
Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
In general synod 'take 1away her power;
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
And bowl the round nave down the 1hill of heaven,
As low as to the fiends!'
LORD POLONIUS 
This is too long.
HAMLET 
It shall to 1the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
sleeps: 1say on: come to Hecuba.
First Player 
'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
HAMLET 
'The1 mobled queen?'
LORD POLONIUS 
That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
First Player 
'Run barefoot 1up and down, threatening the flames
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
Where late the diade1m stood, and for a robe,
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear1 caught up;
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason1 have
pronounced:
But if the gods themselves did see her then
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious1 sport
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
The instant burst of clamour that she made,1
Unless things mortal move them not at all,
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
And 1passion in the gods.'
LORD POLONIUS 
Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
tears in'1s eyes. Pray you, no more.
HAMLET 
'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
Good my lor1d, will you see the players well
bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
they are the ab1stract and brief chronicles of the
time: after your death you were better have a bad
epitaph than 1their ill report while you live.
LORD POLONIUS 
My lord, I will use them according to their desert1.
HAMLET 
God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
after his desert, and who should 'scape1 whipping?
Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
they deserve, the more merit is in1 your bounty.
Take them in.
LORD POLONIUS 
Come, sirs.
HAMLET 
Follow him, friends: we'll hear 1a play to-morrow.
Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First
Dost thou hear me, old friend; 1can you play the
Murder of Gonzago?
First Player 
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET 
We'll ha't to-morrow nig1ht. You could, for a need,
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
I would set down a1nd insert in't, could you not?
First Player 
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET 
Very well. Follow that lord; a1nd look you mock him
not.
Exit First Player
My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
1welcome to Elsinore.
ROSENCRANTZ 
Good my lord!
HAMLET 
Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
Exeunt ROSENCRAN1TZ and GUILDENSTERN
Now I am alone.
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous t1hat this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his own 1conceit
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
1A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
For1 Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
Ha1d he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleav1e the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Confound the ignoran1t, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, p1eak,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
Upon wh1ose property and most dear life
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? bre1aks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me 1the lie i' the throat,
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
Ha!
'Swounds, I should take it:1 for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I 1should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseles1s, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most bra1ve,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must, l1ike a whore, unpack my heart with words,
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
A scullion!
Fie up1on't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very 1cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaim'd their malefact1ions;
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these1 players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
I1'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
May be 2the devil: and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Out of my
May be 3 weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me: I'll ha1ve grounds
More relative than this: the play 's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the1 king.

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS1, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN 
KING CLAUDIUS 
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,1
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbul1ent and dangerous lunacy?
ROSENCRANTZ 
He does confess he feels himself distracted;
But from what1 cause he will by no means speak.
GUILDENSTERN 
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
But, wi1th a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.1
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Did he receive you well?
ROSENCRANTZ 
Most like a gentleman.
GUILDENSTERN 
Bu1t with much forcing of his disposition.
ROSENCRANTZ 
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
Mo1st free in his reply.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Did you assay him?
To any pastime?
ROSENCRANTZ 
Madam, it1 so fell out, that certain players
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
And there did 1seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it: they are about the court,
And, as I think, they have alre1ady order
This night to play before him.
LORD POLONIUS 
'Tis most true:
And he beseech'd me to e1ntreat your majesties
To hear and see the matter.
KING CLAUDIUS 
With all my heart; and it doth m1uch content me
To hear him so inclined.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
And drive his pu1rpose on to these delights.
ROSENCRANTZ 
We shall, my lord.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
1KING CLAUDIUS 
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he,1 as 'twere by accident, may here
Affront Ophelia:
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Will so 1bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
We may of their encounter frankly judge,
And gather by him,1 as he is behaved,
If 't be the affliction of his love or no
That thus he suffers for.
QUEEN GERT1RUDE 
I shall obey you.
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happ1y cause
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again,1
To both your honours.
OPHELIA 
Madam, I wish it may.
Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE
LORD POLONIUS 
Ophel1ia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
We will bestow ourselves.
To OPHELIA
Read on this boo1k;
That show of such an exercise may colour
Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
'Tis 1too much proved--that with devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The devil himself.1
KING CLAUDIUS 
[Aside] O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
T1he harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than 1is my deed to my most painted word:
O heavy burthen!
LORD POLONIUS 
I hear him coming: let's with1draw, my lord.
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS
Enter HAMLET
HAMLET 
To be, or not to be: that 1is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous for1tune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No m1ore; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is hei1r to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: a1y, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this1 mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For wh1o would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The p1angs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit 1of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardel1s bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The u1ndiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather be1ar those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of1 us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
An1d enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the nam1e of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.
OP1HELIA 
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?
HAMLET 
I humbly thank you; well,1 well, well.
OPHELIA 
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
That I have longed long to re-delive1r;
I pray you, now receive them.
HAMLET 
No, not I;
I never gave you aught.
OPHELIA 
My honour1'd lord, you know right well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made th1e things more rich: their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poo1r when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
HAMLET 
Ha, ha! are you honest?
OPHELIA 
My lord?
1HAMLET 
Are you fair?
OPHELIA 
What means your lordship?
HAMLET 
That if you be honest and fair1, your honesty should
admit no discourse to your beauty.
OPHELIA 
Could beauty, my lord, have bet1ter commerce than
with honesty?
HAMLET 
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
transform1 honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
force of honesty can translate beauty into his
likenes1s: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
time gives it proof. I did love you once.
OPHELIA 
In1deed, my lord, you made me believe so.
HAMLET 
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot1
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
it: I loved you not.
OPHELIA 
I was the more d1eceived.
HAMLET 
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
breeder of sinners? I am myself ind1ifferent honest;
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
were better my mother had not bo1rne me: I am very
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
my beck than I have thoughts1 to put them in,
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
in. What should such fellows 1as I do crawling
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
all; believe none of us. Go thy w1ays to a nunnery.
Where's your father?
OPHELIA 
At home, my lord.
HAMLET 
Let the doors be shut1 upon him, that he may play the
fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
OPHELIA 
O, help him,1 you sweet heavens!
HAMLET 
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
thy dowry: be thou1 as chaste as ice, as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
nunnery, go: fare1well. Or, if thou wilt needs
marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
what monsters you 1make of them. To a nunnery, go,
and quickly too. Farewell.
OPHELIA 
O heavenly powers, restore hi1m!
HAMLET 
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
has given you one face, and you m1ake yourselves
another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
nick-name God's creatures, and make 1your wantonness
your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
made me mad. I say, we will have1 no more marriages:
those that are married already, all but one, shall
live; the rest shall keep a1s they are. To a
nunnery, go.
Exit
OPHELIA 
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courti1er's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The gla1ss of fashion and the mould of form,
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
And I, of l1adies most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and mo1st sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feat1ure of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I s1ee!
Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS
KING CLAUDIUS 
Love! his affections do not that way tend;2
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Was not like madness. There's somethinay tend;3g in his soul,
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose1
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he sha1ll with speed to England,
For the demand of our neglected tribute
Haply the seas and countries dif1ferent
With variable objects shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his 1brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
LORD POLONIUS 
I1t shall do well: but yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglect1ed love. How now, Ophelia!
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
We heard it all. My lord, d1o as you please;
But, if you hold it fit, after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat hi1m
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
Of 1all their conference. If she find him not,
To England send him, or confine him where
Your wisdom b1est shall think.
KING CLAUDIUS 
It shall be so:
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
Exe1unt
SCENE II. A hall in the castle.
Enter HAMLET and Players 
HAMLET 
Speak the speech, I pray y1ou, as I pronounced it to
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
as many of your play1ers do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your han1d, thus, but use all gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of1 passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to1 the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to sp1lit the ears of the groundlings, who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dum1bshows and noise: I would have such
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
out-herods Herod:1 pray you, avoid it.
First Player 
I warrant your honour.
HAMLET 
Be not too tame neither, but l1et your own discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
word to the action; with th1is special o'erstep not
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of pl1aying, whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
mirror up to natu1re; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
the time his1 form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
laugh, cann1ot but make the judicious grieve; the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a 1whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and t1hat highly, not to speak it profanely,
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait 1of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature's j1ourneymen had made men and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
First Player 1
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
sir.
HAMLET 
O, reform it altogether. And l1et those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
for there be of them that 1will themselves laugh, to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too; though, in the m1ean time, some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered:
that's villanous, and show1s a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
Exeunt Players
Enter POLO1NIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
LOR1D POLONIUS 
And the queen too, and that presently.
HAMLET 
Bid the players make haste.
Exit POLO1NIUS
Will you two help to hasten them?
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN 
We will, my lord.
Exeunt ROSENC1RANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
HAMLET 
What ho! Horatio!
Enter HORATIO
HORATIO 
Here, sweet lord, at yo1ur service.
HAMLET 
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation coped withal.
H1ORATIO 
O, my dear lord,--
HAMLET 
Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope 1from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor 1be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
And crook the pregnant hinges of the kn1ee
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice1
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
As on1e, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
Hast ta'en wit1h equal thanks: and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
That they are1 not a pipe for fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passi1on's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee.--Somet1hing too much of this.--
There is a play to-night before the king;
One scene of it comes near the 1circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoo1t,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Do not itself1 unkennel in one speech,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
1As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And after we wi1ll both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.
HORATIO 
Well, my lord:
If he steal aught 1the whilst this play is playing,
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
HAMLET 
They are com1ing to the play; I must be idle:
Get you a place.
Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, Q1UEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others
KING CLAUDIUS 
How fares o1ur cousin Hamlet?
HAMLET 
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
the air, promise-cr1ammed: you cannot feed capons so.
KING CLAUDIUS 
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these wo1rds
are not mine.
HAMLET 
No, nor mine now.
To POLONIUS
My lord, you played once i' the univers1ity, you say?
LORD POLONIUS 
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
HAMLET 
What d1id you enact?
LORD POLONIUS 
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
Capitol; Brutus kille1d me.
HAMLET 
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be the players ready?
1ROSENCRANTZ 
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Come hither, my dear Haml1et, sit by me.
HAMLET 
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
LORD POLONIUS 
[To KING CL1AUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?
HAMLET 
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
Lying down at OPHELIA's f1eet
OPHELIA 
No, my lord.
HAMLET 
I mean, my head upon your lap?
OPHELIA 
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET1 
Do you think I meant country matters?
OPHELIA 
I think nothing, my lord.
HAMLET 
That's a fai1r thought to lie between maids' legs.
OPHELIA 
What is, my lord?
HAMLET 
Nothing.
OPHELIA 
You1 are merry, my lord.
HAMLET 
Who, I?
OPHELIA 
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET 
O God, your only jig-maker.1 What should a man do
but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
mother looks, and my father d1ied within these two hours.
OPHELIA 
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
HAMLET 
So long? Nay t1hen, let the devil wear black, for
I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
months ago, and 1not forgotten yet? Then there's
hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
a year: but, b1y'r lady, he must build churches,
then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
the hobby-ho1rse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
the hobby-horse is forgot.'
Hautboys play. The dumb-show en1ters
Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and m1akes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him d1own upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off hi1s crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King2 dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in agathe King3in, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gif1ts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love
Exeunt
OPHELIA 
What me1ans this, my lord?
HAMLET 
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
OPHELIA 
Belike t1his show imports the argument of the play.
Enter Prologue
HAMLET 
We shall know by this fellow: t1he players cannot
keep counsel; they'll tell all.
OPHELIA 
Will he tell us what this show meant?1
HAMLET 
Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell1 you what it means.
OPHELIA 
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
Prologue 
For u1s, and for our tragedy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
We beg your hearing patiently.
Exit
HAML1ET 
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
OPHELIA 
'Tis brief, my lord.
HAMLET 
As woman's1 love.
Enter two Players, King and Queen
Player King 
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone r1ound
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
Abo1ut the world have times twelve thirties been,
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite 1commutual in most sacred bands.
Player Queen 
So many journeys may the sun and moon
Make us again1 count o'er ere love be done!
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
So far from cheer and from 1your former state,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothin1g must:
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
In neither aught, or in extremity.
Now, what my1 love is, proof hath made you know;
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
Where love is great, t1he littlest doubts are fear;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Player King 
1'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
A1nd thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
For husband1 shalt thou--
Player Queen 
O, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
1In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
HAMLET 
[Aside1] Wormwood, wormwood.
Player Queen 
The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of 1thrift, but none of love:
A second time I kill my husband dead,
When second husband kisses me in b1ed.
Player King 
I do believe you think what now you speak;
But what we do determine oft we break1.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
Which now, like fruit 1unripe, sticks on the tree;
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we f1orget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
The pa1ssion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with 1themselves destroy:
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Grief joys, joy grieves, on sle1nder accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our1 fortunes change;
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
Whether love lead fortune, or else for1tune love.
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The poor advanced makes friends of en1emies.
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
And w1ho in want a hollow friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where I b1egun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts 1are ours, their ends none of our own:
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
But die thy though1ts when thy first lord is dead.
Player Queen 
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Sport 1and repose lock from me day and night!
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
An anchor's cheer in1 prison be my scope!
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it 1destroy!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
HAMLET 1
If she should break it now!
Player King 
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
My spir1its grow dull, and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep.
Sleeps
Player Queen 
Sleep r1ock thy brain,
And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit
HAMLET 
Madam, how like you this 1play?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
The lady protests too much, methinks.
HAMLET 
O, but she'll keep her word.1
KING CLAUDIUS 
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
HAMLET 
No, no, they do 1but jest, poison in jest; no offence
i' the world.
KING CLAUDIUS 
What do you call the play?
HAM1LET 
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Go1nzago is
the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: bu1t what o'
that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
touches us not: let the galled jade w1ince, our
withers are unwrung.
Enter LUCIANUS
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
OPHELIA 1
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
HAMLET 
I could interpret between you and your love, if I1
could see the puppets dallying.
OPHELIA 
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
HAMLET 
It would 1cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
OPHELIA 
Still better, and worse.
HAMLET 
So you must t1ake your husbands. Begin, murderer;
pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
'the croaking 1raven doth bellow for revenge.'
LUCIANUS 
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;1
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
Wit1h Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy natural magic and dire property,
On wholesome 1life usurp immediately.
Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears
HAMLET 
He poisons him i' the ga1rden for's estate. His
name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
choice Italian: you shall 1see anon how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
OPHELIA 
The king rises.
HAMLET 
Wha1t, frighted with false fire!
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
How fares my lord?
LORD POLONIUS 
Give o'er the pla1y.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Give me some light: away!
All 
Lights, lights, lights!
Exeunt all but HAMLET 1and HORATIO
HAMLET 
Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The hart ungalled play;
For some must wa1tch, while some must sleep:
So runs the world away.
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-1- if
the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get m1e a
fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
HORATIO 
Half a share.
HAMLET 
A whole one, I.
For th1ou dost know, O Damon dear,
This realm dismantled was
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
A very1, very--pajock.
HORATIO 
You might have rhymed.
HAMLET 
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's wo1rd for a
thousand pound. Didst perceive?
HORATIO 
Very well, my lord.
HAMLET 
Upon the talk of 1the poisoning?
HORATIO 
I did very well note him.
HAMLET 
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the re1corders!
For if the king like not the comedy,
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
Come, som1e music!
Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
GUILDENSTERN 
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word wi1th you.
HAMLET 
Sir, a whole history.
GUILDENSTERN 
The king, sir,--
HAMLET 
Ay, sir, what of 1him?
GUILDENSTERN 
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
HAMLET 
With drink, sir?
GUILDE1NSTERN 
No, my lord, rather with choler.
HAMLET 
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
s1ignify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into fa1r
more choler.
GUILDENSTERN 
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
start not so w1ildly from my affair.
HAMLET 
I am tame, sir: pronounce.
GUILDENSTERN 
The queen, your mother, i1n most great affliction of
spirit, hath sent me to you.
HAMLET 
You are welcome.
GUILDENSTERN 
1Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed. If it shall please you to make me a
wh2olesome answer, I will do your mother's
commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
shame a
wh3ll be the end of my business.
HAMLET 
Sir, I cannot.
GUILDENSTERN 
What, my lord?
HAMLET 
Make1 you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;1
or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
R1OSENCRANTZ 
Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
into amazement and admiration.
HAML1ET 
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
is there no sequel at the heels of this mo1ther's
admiration? Impart.
ROSENCRANTZ 
She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
go 1to bed.
HAMLET 
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
you any further trade with us?1
ROSENCRANTZ 
My lord, you once did love me.
HAMLET 
So I do still, by these pickers and stealer1s.
ROSENCRANTZ 
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
do, surely, bar the door upon 1your own liberty, if
you deny your griefs to your friend.
HAMLET 
Sir, I lack advancement.
ROSEN1CRANTZ 
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in Denmar1k?
HAMLET 
Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
is something musty.
Re-enter Playe1rs with recorders
O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
you:--why do you go about to 1recover the wind of me,
as if you would drive me into a toil?
GUILDENSTERN 
O, my lord, if my dut1y be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
HAMLET 
I do not well understand that. Will you play up1on
this pipe?
GUILDENSTERN 
My lord, I cannot.
HAMLET 
I pray you.
GUILDENSTERN 
Believe me, 1I cannot.
HAMLET 
I do beseech you.
GUILDENSTERN 
I know no touch of it, my lord.
HAMLET 
'Tis1 as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
mou1th, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
Look you, these are the stops.
GUILDENSTERN 
But t1hese cannot I command to any utterance of
harmony; I have not the skill.
HAMLET 
Why, look you no1w, how unworthy a thing you make of
me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
my stops; y1ou would pluck out the heart of my
mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of m1y compass: and there is much music,
excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
you make it 1speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
instrument you 1will, though you can fret me, yet you
cannot play upon me.
Enter POLONIUS
God bless you, sir!
LO1RD POLONIUS 
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
presently.
HAMLET 
Do you see yonder c1loud that's almost in shape of a camel?
LORD POLONIUS 
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.1
HAMLET 
Methinks it is like a weasel.
LORD POLONIUS 
It is backed like a weasel.
HAMLET 
Or l1ike a whale?
LORD POLONIUS 
Very like a whale.
HAMLET 
Then I will come to my mother by and by. 1They fool
me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.
LORD POLONIUS 
I will say so.
HAMLET 1
By and by is easily said.
Exit POLONIUS
Leave me, friends.
Exeunt all but HAMLET
Tis now the v1ery witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this w1orld: now could I drink hot blood,
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on. 1Soft! now to my mother.
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this fir1m bosom:
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
My tongue and1 soul in this be hypocrites;
How in my words soever she be shent,
To give them seals never, my sou1l, consent!
Exit
SCENE III. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENST1ERN 
KING CLAUDIUS 
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range. Therefor1e prepare you;
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you:1
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacie1s.
GUILDENSTERN 
We will ourselves provide:
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those man1y many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your majesty.
ROSENCRANTZ 
The single and peculiar lif1e is bound,
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
To keep itself from noyance; but much mo1re
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
Dies not a1lone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
Fix'd on the summit1 of the highest mount,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoin'd; 1which, when it falls,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never 1alone
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Arm you, I pray you, to this sp1eedy voyage;
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
Which now goes too free-footed.
ROSENCRANTZ 1GUILDENSTERN 
We will haste us.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Enter POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS1 
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
To hear the pr1ocess; and warrant she'll tax him home:
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
'Tis meet that s1ome more audience than a mother,
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
The speech, of v1antage. Fare you well, my liege:
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
And tell you what I know.
1KING CLAUDIUS 
Thanks, dear my lord.
Exit POLONIUS
O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
It1 hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as1 sharp as will:
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
And, like a man to double business bou1nd,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
Were t1hicker than itself with brother's blood,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it 1white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?
And what's in prayer bu1t this two-fold force,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll lo1ok up;
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder1'?
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
My cro1wn, mine own ambition and my queen.
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
In the corrupted c1urrents of this world
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft 'tis seen the wicked pri1ze itself
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
I1n his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To gi1ve in evidence. What then? what rests?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Yet what can it w1hen one can not repent?
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, struggling t1o be free,
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with string1s of steel,
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
All may be well.
Retires and kneels
Enter HAM1LET
HAMLET 
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven1;
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
A villain kills my father; and for that,
I, his so1le son, do this same villain send
To heaven.
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
He took my 1father grossly, full of bread;
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
And how his audit1 stands who knows save heaven?
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
'Tis heavy with him:1 and am I then revenged,
To take him in the purging of his soul,
When he is fit and season'd for h1is passage?
No!
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
When he is drunk asleep, or in his r1age,
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
At gaming, swearing, or about some act
That has no1 relish of salvation in't;
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
And that his soul may1 be as damn'd and black
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
This physic but prolongs thy si2ckly days.
Exit
KING CLAUDIUS 
[Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
Wordss thy si3 without thoughts never to heaven go.
Exit
SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.
Enter QUEEN MARGARET and1 POLONIUS 
LORD POLONIUS 
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
Tell him his pranks ha1ve been too broad to bear with,
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
Much heat and 1him. I'll sconce me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.
HAMLET 
[Within] Mother, mother, moth1er!
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
I'll warrant you,
Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.
POLONIUS hides b1ehind the arras
Enter HAMLET
HAMLET 
Now, mother, what's the matter?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Hamlet, th1ou hast thy father much offended.
HAMLET 
Mother, you have my father much offended.
QUEEN GERTRUD1E 
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
HAMLET 
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.1
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Why, how now, Hamlet!
HAMLET 
What's the matter now?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Have you1 forgot me?
HAMLET 
No, by the rood, not so:
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
A1nd--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Nay, then, I'll set those to you tha1t can speak.
HAMLET 
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
You go not till I set you1 up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
What wilt thou do? thou wil1t not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
LORD POLONIUS 
[Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
HAMLET 
[D1rawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
Makes a pass through the arras
LORD POLONIUS 
[B1ehind] O, I am slain!
Falls and dies
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
O me, what hast thou done?
HAMLET 
Nay, I 1know not:
Is it the king?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
HAMLET 
A blo1ody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 1
As kill a king!
HAMLET 
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS
Thou1 wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
Thou find1'st to be too busy is some danger.
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
And let me w1ring your heart; for so I shall,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
If damned custom have not bras1s'd it so
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
What have I done, that thou1 darest wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?
HAMLET 
Such an act
That blurs the grace and1 blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocen1t love
And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
As1 from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words: 1heaven's face doth glow:
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against th1e doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thu1nders in the index?
HAMLET 
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentmen1t of two brothers.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove 1himself;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
A station like the herald Mercury
New-lighted1 on a heaven-kissing hill;
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his se1al,
To give the world assurance of a man:
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
Here1 is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on1 this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it 1love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waits upon the judgment: 1and what judgment
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Else could you not have mot1ion; but sure, that sense
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er 1so thrall'd
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
To serve in such a difference. What devil was1't
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears1 without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mop1e.
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
To fla1ming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
When the compulsive a1rdour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
And reason panders will.
QUEEN G1ERTRUDE 
O Hamlet, speak no more:
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
And there I see such 1black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.
HAMLET 
Nay, but to live
In the rank swea1t of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty,--
QUEEN 1GERTRUDE 
O, speak to me no more;
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet H1amlet!
HAMLET 
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your pr1ecedent lord; a vice of kings;
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precio1us diadem stole,
And put it in his pocket!
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
No more!
HAMLET 
A king of shreds an1d patches,--
Enter Ghost
Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards! What wo1uld your gracious figure?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Alas, he's mad!
HAMLET 
Do you not come your tardy son1 to chide,
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command1? O, say!
Ghost 
Do not forget: this visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But, 1look, amazement on thy mother sits:
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
Conceit in weakest 1bodies strongest works:
Speak to her, Hamlet.
HAMLET 
How is it with you, lady?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 1
Alas, how is't with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold1 discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alar1m,
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
Upon th1e heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
HAMLET 
On him, on1 him! Look you, how pale he glares!
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Would make 1them capable. Do not look upon me;
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects: the1n what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
To whom do 1you speak this?
HAMLET 
Do you see nothing there?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Nothing at all; yet all that i1s I see.
HAMLET 
Nor did you nothing hear?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
No, nothing but ourselves.
HAMLET 
1Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he lived!
Look, where he1 goes, even now, out at the portal!
Exit Ghost
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
This the very coinage of your brai1n:
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in.
HAMLET 
Ecstasy!
My pulse, as yours, doth1 temperately keep time,
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
That I have utter'd: bring1 me to the test,
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
Would gambol from. Mother, for love 1of grace,
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
That not your trespass, but my madness spea1ks:
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Infe1cts unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
And do not spre1ad the compost on the weeds,
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
For in the fatness of1 these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him go1od.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
HAMLET 
O, throw away the worse1r part of it,
And live the purer with the other half.
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;1
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits devi1l, is angel yet in this,
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or liv2ery,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To thk or liv3e next abstinence: the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
And either [1 ] the devil, or throw him out
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
And when you are desi1rous to be bless'd,
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
Pointing to POLONIUS
I do repen1t: but heaven hath pleased it so,
To punish me with this and this with me,
That I must be their sc1ourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him. So, again, good 1night.
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
One word more,1 good lady.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
What shall I do?
HAMLET 
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
1Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
And let1 him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Make you to r1avel all this matter out,
That I essentially am not in madness,
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you 1let him know;
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a 1gib,
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
Unpeg the 1basket on the house's top.
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
To try conclusions, in the1 basket creep,
And break your own neck down.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Be thou assured, if words be made of1 breath,
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me.
HAMLET 
I must1 to England; you know that?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Alack,
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
HAMLET 
1There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
They 1bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
For 'tis the spo1rt to have the engineer
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
But I will delve one yard 1below their mines,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
When in one line two crafts dire1ctly meet.
This man shall set me packing:
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
Mother, good1 night. Indeed this counsellor
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
Who was in life a fo1olish prating knave.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night, mother.
Exeunt severa1lly; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS
ACT IV
SCENE I. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN1 GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN 
KING CLAUDIUS 
There's matter in these sighs, these prof1ound heaves:
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 1
Bestow this place on us a little while.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Ah, my good lord, wha1t have I seen to-night!
KING CLAUDIUS 
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Mad as t1he sea and wind, when both contend
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
Behind the arras hea1ring something stir,
Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
And, in this brainish apprehensi1on, kills
The unseen good old man.
KING CLAUDIUS 
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we b1een there:
His liberty is full of threats to all;
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how1 shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
It will be laid to us, whose providence
Should have kept shor1t, restrain'd and out of haunt,
This mad young man: but so much was our love,
We would not underst1and what was most fit;
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
To keep it from divulging, let it fe1ed
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
To draw apart the body he hath kil1l'd:
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base,
Shows itself pure;1 he weeps for what is done.
KING CLAUDIUS 
O Gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mou1ntains touch,
But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
We must, with all our majesty and ski1ll,
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Friends 1both, go join you with some further aid:
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And from his mothe1r's closet hath he dragg'd him:
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
Into the chapel. I1 pray you, haste in this.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wi1sest friends;
And let them know, both what we mean to do,
And what's untimely done. O, come away!1
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
Exeunt
SCENE II. Another room in the castle.
Enter HAMLET1 
HAMLET 
Safely stowed.
ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN: 
[Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
HAMLET 
Wha1t noise? who calls on Hamlet?
O, here they come.
Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
ROSENCRANTZ 1
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
HAMLET 
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis ki1n.
ROSENCRANTZ 
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel.
HAMLET1 
Do not believe it.
ROSENCRANTZ 
Believe what?
HAMLET 
That I can keep your counsel and not mi1ne own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
replication should be made by the son of a king?1
ROSENCRANTZ 
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
HAMLET 
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's count1enance, his
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
king best service in the end: he ke1eps them, like
an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
be last swallowed: when he need1s what you have
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
shall be dry again.
ROSENCRANT1Z 
I understand you not, my lord.
HAMLET 
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish 1ear.
ROSENCRANTZ 
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
with us to the king.
HAMLE1T 
The body is with the king, but the king is not with
the body. The king is a thing--
GUILDENSTE1RN 
A thing, my lord!
HAMLET 
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
Exeunt
SCEN1E III. Another room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended 
KING CLAUDIUS 
I have sent to s1eek him, and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put t1he strong law on him:
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their judgment, but 1their eyes;
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
But never the offence. To bear al1l smooth and even,
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate gro1wn
By desperate appliance are relieved,
Or not at all.
Enter ROSENCRANTZ
How now! what hath befa1ll'n?
ROSENCRANTZ 
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
We cannot get from him.
KING CLAUDI1US 
But where is he?
ROSENCRANTZ 
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
KING CLAUDIU1S 
Bring him before us.
ROSENCRANTZ 
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
Enter HAMLET and GUILDE1NSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS 
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
HAMLET 
At supper.
KING CLAUDIUS 
At supp1er! where?
HAMLET 
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
convocation of politic wor1ms are e'en at him. Your
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
creatures else to fat us, 1and we fat ourselves for
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
variable service, two 1dishes, but to one table:
that's the end.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Alas, alas!
HAMLET 
A man may fish wit1h the worm that hath eat of a
king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
KING CLAUDIUS 1
What dost you mean by this?
HAMLET 
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
progress throug1h the guts of a beggar.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Where is Polonius?
HAMLET 
In heaven; send hither to see:1 if your messenger
find him not there, seek him i' the other place
yourself. But indeed, if you fi1nd him not within
this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
stairs into the lobby.
KING CLA1UDIUS 
Go seek him there.
To some Attendants
HAMLET 
He will stay till ye come.
Exeunt Attendan1ts
KING CLAUDIUS 
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
Which we do tender, as we dearl1y grieve
For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
With fiery quickness: therefore prep2are thyself;
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
The associates tend, and every thingore prep3 is bent
For England.
HAMLET 
For England!
KING CLAUDIUS 
Ay, Hamlet.
HAMLET 
Good.
KING CLA1UDIUS 
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
HAMLET 
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; 1for
England! Farewell, dear mother.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
HAMLET 
My mother1: father and mother is man and wife; man
and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for Englan1d!
Exit
KING CLAUDIUS 
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
Delay it not; I'll have 1him hence to-night:
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
That else leans on the affair: pray y1ou, make haste.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught1--
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After1 the Danish sword, and thy free awe
Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign pro1cess; which imports at full,
By letters congruing to that effect,
The present death of Hamlet. Do 1it, England;
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis don1e,
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
Exit
SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.
Enter FORTINBRA1S, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching 
PRINCE FORTINBRAS 
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish kin1g;
Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Over his k1ingdom. You know the rendezvous.
If that his majesty would aught with us,
We shall express our dut1y in his eye;
And let him know so.
Captain 
I will do't, my lord.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS 
Go softly 1on.
Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers
Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others
HAMLET 
G1ood sir, whose powers are these?
Captain 
They are of Norway, sir.
HAMLET 
How purposed, sir, I 1pray you?
Captain 
Against some part of Poland.
HAMLET 
Who commands them, sir?
Captain 
The n1ephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
HAMLET 
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Or for some fr1ontier?
Captain 
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
We go to gain a little patch of ground
Th1at hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
Nor will it y1ield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
HAMLET 
Why, then the Polack 1never will defend it.
Captain 
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
HAMLET 
Two thousand souls and twe1nty thousand ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw:
This is the imposthume of much wea1lth and peace,
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you1, sir.
Captain 
God be wi' you, sir.
Exit
ROSENCRANTZ 
Wilt please you go, my lord?
HAMLET 
I1'll be with you straight go a little before.
Exeunt all except HAMLET
How all occasions do inform 1against me,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
If his chief good and market of his time
Be 1but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
Looking 1before and after, gave us not
That capability and god-like reason
To fust in us unused. Now, wheth1er it be
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
Of thinking too precisely on the event,
A thoug1ht which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
And ever three parts coward, I do not know
Why yet I1 live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
To do't. Exam1ples gross as earth exhort me:
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and ten1der prince,
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Exposin1g what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
Even for an egg-shell. Rig1htly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
Wh1en honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
Excitemen1ts of my reason and my blood,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
The imminent death of t1wenty thousand men,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
Go to their graves like beds, fight for1 a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Which is not tomb enough and continent
To hide 1the slain? O, from this time forth,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
Exit
SCENE V. Els1inore. A room in the castle.
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman 
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
I wi1ll not speak with her.
Gentleman 
She is importunate, indeed distract:
Her mood will needs be pit1ied.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
What would she have?
Gentleman 
She speaks much of her father; says she hea1rs
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks 1things in doubt,
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
Yet the unshaped use of it doth1 move
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;1
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
yield them,
Indeed would make one think there might 1be thought,
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
HORATIO 
'Twere good she were spoken with; f1or she may strew
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Let her come in.
E1xit HORATIO
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:1
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
Re-enter HORATIO,1 with OPHELIA
OPHELIA 
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
How now, Ophel1ia!
OPHELIA 
[Sings]
How should I your true love know
From another one?
By his cockle hat and s1taff,
And his sandal shoon.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
OPHELIA 
1Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
Sings
He is dead and gone, lady,
He is dead and gone;
At his head 1a grass-green turf,
At his heels a stone.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Nay, but, Ophelia,--
OPHELIA 
Pray yo1u, mark.
Sings
White his shroud as the mountain snow,--
Enter KING CLAUDIUS
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Ala1s, look here, my lord.
OPHELIA 
[Sings]
Larded with sweet flowers
Which bewept to the grave did 1go
With true-love showers.
KING CLAUDIUS 
How do you, pretty lady?
OPHELIA 
Well, God 'ild you!1 They say the owl was a baker's
daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
what we may be. 1God be at your table!
KING CLAUDIUS 
Conceit upon her father.
OPHELIA 
Pray you, let's have no w1ords of this; but when they
ask you what it means, say you this:
Sings
To-morrow is Saint Valenti1ne's day,
All in the morning betime,
And I a maid at your window,
To be your Valentine.
Then up 1he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
And dupp'd the chamber-door;
Let in the maid, that out a maid
Ne1ver departed more.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Pretty Ophelia!
OPHELIA 
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll mak1e an end on't:
Sings
By Gis and by Saint Charity,
Alack, and fie for shame!
Young men will do't,1 if they come to't;
By cock, they are to blame.
Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
You promised me1 to wed.
So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
An thou hadst not come to my bed.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Ho1w long hath she been thus?
OPHELIA 
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
cannot cho1ose but weep, to think they should lay him
i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
and so1 I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
1good night, good night.
Exit
KING CLAUDIUS 
Follow her close; give her good watch,
I pray you.
1Exit HORATIO
O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
All from her father's death. O Gertru1de, Gertrude,
When sorrows come, they come not single spies
But in battalions. First, her father s1lain:
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,1
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
For good Polonius' death; and we have done b1ut greenly,
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
Divided from herself and her fair judgment1,
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
Last, and as much containing as all these,
H2er brother is in secret come from France;
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
Anhese,
H3d wants not buzzers to infect his ear
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
Wherein neces1sity, of matter beggar'd,
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertr1ude, this,
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
Gives me superfluous death.
A noise within
1QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Alack, what noise is this?
KING CLAUDIUS 
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard t1he door.
Enter another Gentleman
What is the matter?
Gentleman 
Save yourself, my lord:
The oce1an, overpeering of his list,
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
Than young Laertes, in a1 riotous head,
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
And, as the world were now but t1o begin,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
The ratifiers and props of every word,
They cry 'Cho1ose we: Laertes shall be king:'
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
'Laertes shall1 be king, Laertes king!'
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
O, this is c1ounter, you false Danish dogs!
KING CLAUDIUS 
The doors are broke.
Noise within
Enter LAERTES, a1rmed; Danes following
LAERTES 
Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
Danes 
No, let's1 come in.
LAERTES 
I pray you, give me leave.
Danes 
We will, we will.
They retire without the 1door
LAERTES 
I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
Give me my father!
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
1Calmly, good Laertes.
LAERTES 
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
Cries cuckold1 to my father, brands the harlot
Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
Of my true mother.1
KING CLAUDIUS 
What is the cause, Laertes,
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
Let him go, G1ertrude; do not fear our person:
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
That treason can but pee1p to what it would,
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
Why thou art thus incensed. Let him1 go, Gertrude.
Speak, man.
LAERTES 
Where is my father?
KING CLAUDIUS 
Dead.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
1But not by him.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Let him demand his fill.
LAERTES 
How came he dead? I'll not be j1uggled with:
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the profou1ndest pit!
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
Le1t come what comes; only I'll be revenged
Most thoroughly for my father.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Who shall 1stay you?
LAERTES 
My will, not all the world:
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
They1 shall go far with little.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Good Laertes,
If you desire to know the certainty
Of y1our dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and1 foe,
Winner and loser?
LAERTES 
None but his enemies.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Will you know them then?1
LAERTES 
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
And like the kind life-rendering pelican1,
Repast them with my blood.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Why, now you speak
Like a good child and a true gent1leman.
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
And am most sensible in grief for it,
It shall1 as level to your judgment pierce
As day does to your eye.
Danes 
[Within] Let her come in.
LAER1TES 
How now! what noise is that?
Re-enter OPHELIA
O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times sa1lt,
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
Ti1ll our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens! is't 1possible, a young maid's wits
Should be as moral as an old man's life?
Nature is fine in love, and1 where 'tis fine,
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves.
OPHELIA 
[1Sings]
They bore him barefaced on the bier;
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
And in his grave rai1n'd many a tear:--
Fare you well, my dove!
LAERTES 
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade reven1ge,
It could not move thus.
OPHELIA 
[Sings]
You must sing a-down a-down,
An you call him a-dow1n-a.
O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
steward, that stole his master's daughter.
LAER1TES 
This nothing's more than matter.
OPHELIA 
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
l1ove, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
LAERTES 
A document in madness, thoughts1 and remembrance fitted.
OPHELIA 
There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
for you; an1d here's some for me: we may call it
herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
a differ1ence. There's a daisy: I would give you
some violets, but they withered all when my father
died: t1hey say he made a good end,--
Sings
For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
LAERTES 
Thought and af1fliction, passion, hell itself,
She turns to favour and to prettiness.
OPHELIA 
[Sings]
And will1 he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead:
Go to thy death-bed:
He neve1r will come again.
His beard was as white as snow,
All flaxen was his poll:
He is gone, he is gon1e,
And we cast away moan:
God ha' mercy on his soul!
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God 1be wi' ye.
Exit
LAERTES 
Do you see this, O God?
KING CLAUDIUS 
Laertes, I must commune with yo1ur grief,
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
A1nd they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
If by direct or by collateral hand
They find us to1uch'd, we will our kingdom give,
Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
To you in satisfac1tion; but if not,
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
And we shall jointly labour with you1r soul
To give it due content.
LAERTES 
Let this be so;
His means of death, his obscure funeral-1-
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
Cry to b1e heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
That I must call't in question.
KING CLAUDIUS 
So you sh1all;
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
I pray you, go with me.
Exeunt
SCENE VI. A1nother room in the castle.
Enter HORATIO and a Servant 
HORATIO 
What are they that would speak w1ith me?
Servant 
Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.
HORATIO 
Let them come in.
E1xit Servant
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet1.
Enter Sailors
First Sailor 
God bless you, sir.
HORATIO 
Let him bless thee too.
First Sailo1r 
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you, sir; it comes from the ambassador tha1t was
bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am
let to know it is.
HORATIO 
[Reads] 'H1oratio, when thou shalt have overlooked
this, give these fellows some means to the king:
they have1 letters for him. Ere we were two days old
at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
ch1ase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded1
them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
I alone became their prisoner. They have deal1t with
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let1 the king
have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
with as much speed as thou wouldst f1ly death. I
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
dumb; yet are they much too light for 1the bore of
the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenster1n hold their
course for England: of them I have much to tell
thee. Farewell.
'He that thou knowes1t thine, HAMLET.'
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
And do't the speedier, that yo1u may direct me
To him from whom you brought them.
Exeunt
SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.1
Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES 
KING CLAUDIUS 
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
A1nd you must put me in your heart for friend,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
That he 1which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life.
LAERTES 
It well appears: but tell me
Why yo1u proceeded not against these feats,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
As by your safety, wisd2om, all things else,
You mainly were stirr'd up.
KING CLAUDIUS 
O, for two special reasonty, wisd3s;
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mo1ther
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
She1's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
I could not 1but by her. The other motive,
Why to a public count I might not go,
Is the great love the general 1gender bear him;
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Would, like the spring that turne1th wood to stone,
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
Too slightly timber'd for so lou1d a wind,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
And not where I had aim'd them.
LAERTES 
And so h1ave I a noble father lost;
A sister driven into desperate terms,
Whose worth, if praises may go ba1ck again,
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.1
KING CLAUDIUS 
Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
That we are made of stuff so fl1at and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
And think it pastime. You shortly shall1 hear more:
I loved your father, and we love ourself;
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-1-
Enter a Messenger
How now! what news?
Messenger 
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
This to your 1majesty; this to the queen.
KING CLAUDIUS 
From Hamlet! who brought them?
Messenger 
Sailors, my1 lord, they say; I saw them not:
They were given me by Claudio; he received them
Of him that broug1ht them.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
Exit Messenger
Reads
'High and 1mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
your kin1gly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
and 1more strange return. 'HAMLET.'
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
Or is it some ab1use, and no such thing?
LAERTES 
Know you the hand?
KING CLAUDIUS 
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Nake1d!
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
Can you advise me?
LAERTES 
I'm lost in it, my lor1d. But let him come;
It warms the very sickness in my heart,
That I shall live and tell him to his1 teeth,
'Thus didest thou.'
KING CLAUDIUS 
If it be so, Laertes--
As how should it be so? how ot1herwise?--
Will you be ruled by me?
LAERTES 
Ay, my lord;
So you will not o'errule me to a peace1.
KING CLAUDIUS 
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
As checking at his voyage, and that h1e means
No more to undertake it, I will work him
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
Under the 1which he shall not choose but fall:
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
But even his1 mother shall uncharge the practise
And call it accident.
LAERTES 
My lord, I will be ruled;
The1 rather, if you could devise it so
That I might be the organ.
KING CLAUDIUS 
It falls right.
You1 have been talk'd of since your travel much,
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
Wherein, 1they say, you shine: your sum of parts
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one, 1and that, in my regard,
Of the unworthiest siege.
LAERTES 
What part is that, my lord?
KING CLAU1DIUS 
A very riband in the cap of youth,
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
The light and1 careless livery that it wears
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
Importing health and gra1veness. Two months since,
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
I've seen myself, and served against1, the French,
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto h1is seat;
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
1With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
Come s1hort of what he did.
LAERTES 
A Norman was't?
KING CLAUDIUS 
A Norman.
LAERTES 
Upon my life, 1Lamond.
KING CLAUDIUS 
The very same.
LAERTES 
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
And gem1 of all the nation.
KING CLAUDIUS 
He made confession of you,
And gave you such a masterly report1
For art and exercise in your defence
And for your rapier most especially,
That he cried out, 'tw1ould be a sight indeed,
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
He swore, had had ne1ither motion, guard, nor eye,
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom w1ith his envy
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.1
Now, out of this,--
LAERTES 
What out of this, my lord?
KING CLAUDIUS 
Laertes, was your father1 dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart?
LAERTES 
Why ask1 you this?
KING CLAUDIUS 
Not that I think you did not love your father;
But that I know love is 1begun by time;
And that I see, in passages of proof,
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
The1re lives within the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
And nothing is 1at a like goodness still;
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
Dies in his own too much: that we wo1uld do
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
And hath abatements and delays as many1
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh1,
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
Hamlet comes back: what would you undert1ake,
To show yourself your father's son in deed
More than in words?
LAERTES 
To cut his throat i1' the church.
KING CLAUDIUS 
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Revenge should have no 1bounds. But, good Laertes,
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Hamlet return'd shall1 know you are come home:
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
And set a double varnish 1on the fame
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
And wager on your heads: he, being 1remiss,
Most generous and free from all contriving,
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,1
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
Requite hi1m for your father.
LAERTES 
I will do't:
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
I bought a1n unction of a mountebank,
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Where it draws blood no cataplas1m so rare,
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon, can save the thing from dea1th
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slig1htly,
It may be death.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Let's further think of this;
Weigh what convenience both o1f time and means
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
And that our drift look through our1 bad performance,
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
Should have a back or second, 1that might hold,
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
We'll make a solemn wager on you1r cunnings: I ha't.
When in your motion you are hot and dry--
As make your bouts more violent to t1hat end--
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but1 sipping,
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
Our purpose may hold there.
Enter QUEEN GERT1RUDE
How now, sweet queen!
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
So fast they 1follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
LAERTES 
Drown'd! O, where?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
There is a w1illow grows aslant a brook,
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
There with fantastic 1garlands did she come
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
That liberal shepherds g1ive a grosser name,
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
There, on the pendent boug1hs her coronet weeds
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
When down her weedy trophies and1 herself
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore h1er up:
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
As one incapable of her own distress,
Or lik1e a creature native and indued
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Till that her garments,2 heavy with their drink,
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death.
LAarments,3ERTES 
Alas, then, she is drown'd?
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Drown'd, drown'd.
LAERTES 
Too much of water1 hast thou, poor Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
It is our trick; nature her cus1tom holds,
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:1
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
But that this folly douts it.
Exit
KING CLAUDIU1S 
Let's follow, Gertrude:
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
Now fear I this will give it st1art again;
Therefore let's follow.
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. A churchyard.
Enter two Clowns, with s1pades, & c 
First Clown 
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
wilfully seeks her own salv1ation?
Second Clown 
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
straight: the crowner hath 1sat on her, and finds it
Christian burial.
First Clown 
How can that be, unless she drowned herse1lf in her
own defence?
Second Clown 
Why, 'tis found so.
First Clown 
It must be 'se offendendo1;' it cannot be else. For
here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
it argues an act: and 1an act hath three branches: it
is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
herself wittingly1.
Second Clown 
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
First Clown 
Give me leave. Here lies the w1ater; good: here
stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
and drown himself, it is, will1 he, nill he, he
goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
and drown him, he drowns not h1imself: argal, he
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
Second Clown 
Bu1t is this law?
First Clown 
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
Second Clown 
Will you ha' the1 truth on't? If this had not been
a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
Christian buri1al.
First Clown 
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
great folk should have countenanc1e in this world to
drown or hang themselves, more than their even
Christian. Come, my spade. There1 is no ancient
gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
they hold up Adam's profession1.
Second Clown 
Was he a gentleman?
First Clown 
He was the first that ever bore arms.
Second C1lown 
Why, he had none.
First Clown 
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture1? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
could he dig without arms? I'll put another
question to thee: 1if thou answerest me not to the
purpose, confess thyself--
Second Clown 
Go to.
First Clown 
Wh1at is he that builds stronger than either the
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
Second Clow1n 
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
thousand tenants.
First Clown 
I like thy wit we1ll, in good faith: the gallows
does well; but how does it well? it does well to
those that do in: 1now thou dost ill to say the
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
the gallows may do 1well to thee. To't again, come.
Second Clown 
'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or1
a carpenter?'
First Clown 
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Second Clown 
Marry, now I can tell.
1First Clown 
To't.
Second Clown 
Mass, I cannot tell.
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance
F1irst Clown 
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
ass will not mend his pace with beat1ing; and, when
you are asked this question next, say 'a
grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes las1t till
doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
stoup of liquor.
Exit Second Clown
He digs 1and sings
In youth, when I did love, did love,
Methought it was very sweet,
To contract, O, the t1ime, for, ah, my behove,
O, methought, there was nothing meet.
HAMLET 
Has this fellow no feeling1 of his business, that he
sings at grave-making?
HORATIO 
Custom hath made it in him a property o1f easiness.
HAMLET 
'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
the daintier sense.
First C1lown 
[Sings]
But age, with his stealing steps,
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
And hath shipped m1e intil the land,
As if I had never been such.
Throws up a skull
HAMLET 
That skull had a tongue1 in it, and could sing once:
how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
Cain's jaw-bone, 1that did the first murder! It
might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
now o'er-reaches; 1one that would circumvent God,
might it not?
HORATIO 
It might, my lord.
HAMLET 
Or of a courti1er; which could say 'Good morrow,
sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
be my lord suc1h-a-one, that praised my lord
such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
HORATIO 1
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET 
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
knocked about the mazza1rd with a sexton's spade:
here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
see't. Did these bones co1st no more the breeding,
but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
First Clown 
[1Sings]
A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
For and a shrouding sheet:
O, a pit of clay for to be ma1de
For such a guest is meet.
Throws up another skull
HAMLET 
There's another: why may not that b1e the skull of a
lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
his cases, his tenures, and hi1s tricks? why does he
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
sconce with a dirty shovel1, and will not tell him of
his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
in's time a great buye1r of land, with his statutes,
his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
his recoveries: i1s this the fine of his fines, and
the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
pate full of fi1ne dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
the lengt1h and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
this b1ox; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
HORATIO 
Not a jot more, my lord.
HAMLET 
I1s not parchment made of sheepskins?
HORATIO 
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
HAMLET 
They ar1e sheep and calves which seek out assurance
in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
grave's th1is, sirrah?
First Clown 
Mine, sir.
Sings
O, a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is m1eet.
HAMLET 
I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
First Clown 
You lie out on't, si1r, and therefore it is not
yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
HAMLET 
'Th1ou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore t1hou liest.
First Clown 
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
you.
HAMLET 
What m1an dost thou dig it for?
First Clown 
For no man, sir.
HAMLET 
What woman, then?
First Clown 
1For none, neither.
HAMLET 
Who is to be buried in't?
First Clown 
One that was a woman, sir; but1, rest her soul, she's dead.
HAMLET 
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
card, or equ1ivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
it; the age1 is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
gaffs h1is kibe. How long hast thou been a
grave-maker?
First Clown 
Of all the days i' the year, I came 1to't that day
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
HAMLET 
How long is that since?
Fir1st Clown 
Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
was the very day that young Hamlet wa1s born; he that
is mad, and sent into England.
HAMLET 
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
1First Clown 
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
there; or, if he do not, it's no g1reat matter there.
HAMLET 
Why?
First Clown 
'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
1are as mad as he.
HAMLET 
How came he mad?
First Clown 
Very strangely, they say.
HAMLET 
How 1strangely?
First Clown 
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
HAMLET 
Upon what ground?
First Clown1 
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
and boy, thirty years.
HAMLET 
How long wil1l a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
First Clown 
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as 2we
have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
hold the laying in--he will last yodie--as 3u some eight year
or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
HAMLET 
Why he more than anothe1r?
First Clown 
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
he will keep out water a gre1at while; and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
Here's a skull now; this sk1ull has lain in the earth
three and twenty years.
HAMLET 
Whose was it?
First Clown 
A whoreson1 mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
HAMLET 
Nay, I know not.
First Clown 
A pestile1nce on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
sir, w1as Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
HAMLET 
This?
First Clown 
E'en that.
HAMLET 
Let me see1.
Takes the skull
Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
of infinite jest, of most exce1llent fancy: he hath
borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
abhorred in my imaginatio1n it is! my gorge rims at
it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
not how oft. Where be1 your gibes now? your
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
that were wont to set the ta1ble on a roar? Not one
now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
Now get you to my lady's1 chamber, and tell her, let
her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
come; make her laugh 1at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
me one thing.
HORATIO 
What's that, my lord?
HAMLET 
Dost thou 1think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
the earth?
HORATIO 
E'en so.
HAMLET 
And smelt so? pa1h!
Puts down the skull
HORATIO 
E'en so, my lord.
HAMLET 
To what base uses we may return, Hora1tio! Why may
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
till he find it stopping a bung-ho1le?
HORATIO 
'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
HAMLET 
No, faith, not a jot; but1 to follow him thither with
modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
thus: Alexander died, Al1exander was buried,
Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
earth we make loam; and w1hy of that loam, whereto he
was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
Imperious Caesar, de1ad and turn'd to clay,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
O, that that earth, which kept the1 world in awe,
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
But soft! but soft! aside: here comes1 the king.
Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following;1 KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, & c
The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow1?
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
For1do its own life: 'twas of some estate.
Couch we awhile, and mark.
Retiring with HORATIO
LAERTES 1
What ceremony else?
HAMLET 
That is Laertes,
A very noble youth: mark.
LAERTES 
What ceremony 1else?
First Priest 
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
As we have warrantise: her death was 1doubtful;
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
She should in ground unsanctified have 1lodged
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown 1on her;
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
Of1 bell and burial.
LAERTES 
Must there no more be done?
First Priest 
No more be done:
We should1 profane the service of the dead
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
As to peace-parted souls.1
LAERTES 
Lay her i' the earth:
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring! I tell1 thee, churlish priest,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
When thou liest howling.
HAMLET 1
What, the fair Ophelia!
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
Scattering flowers
I hop1ed thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
A1nd not have strew'd thy grave.
LAERTES 
O, treble woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,1
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
Till I ha1ve caught her once more in mine arms:
Leaps into the grave
Now pile your dust upon the quick and d1ead,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blu1e Olympus.
HAMLET 
[Advancing] What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sor1row
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
Ha1mlet the Dane.
Leaps into the grave
LAERTES 
The devil take thy soul!
Grappling with him
HAMLET1 
Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
For, though I am not splenit1ive and rash,
Yet have I something in me dangerous,
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand1.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Pluck them asunder.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Hamlet, Hamlet!
All 
Gentlemen,--
HORATI1O 
Good my lord, be quiet.
The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave
HAMLET 
Why 1I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
O my s1on, what theme?
HAMLET 
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
Could not, with all their quanti1ty of love,
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
KING CLAUDIUS 
O, he is mad, Laertes.
QUE1EN GERTRUDE 
For love of God, forbear him.
HAMLET 
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
Woo't weep1? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
I'll do't. D1ost thou come here to whine?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, an1d so will I:
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
Millions of acres on us, till our gro1und,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
I'1ll rant as well as thou.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
This is mere madness:
And thus awhile the fit will work 1on him;
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
His sil1ence will sit drooping.
HAMLET 
Hear you, sir;
What is the reason that you use me thus?
I loved 1you ever: but it is no matter;
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
The cat will mew and dog will 1have his day.
Exit
KING CLAUDIUS 
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
Exit HORATIO
To LAER1TES
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
We'll put the matter to the present push.1
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument:
An hour of1 quiet shortly shall we see;
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A hall in1 the castle.
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO 
HAMLET 
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other1;
You do remember all the circumstance?
HORATIO 
Remember it, my lord?
HAMLET 
Sir, in my heart1 there was a kind of fighting,
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
Worse than the mutines1 in the bilboes. Rashly,
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
Our indiscretion sometimes s1erves us well,
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
There's a divinity that shape1s our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will,--
HORATIO 
That is most certain.
HAMLET 
Up from my cab1in,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
Finger'd 1their packet, and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again; making so bold,
My fears forgetting man1ners, to unseal
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
O royal knavery!--an exact comma1nd,
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
With,1 ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
No, not to stay t1he grinding of the axe,
My head should be struck off.
HORATIO 
Is't possible?
HAMLET 
Here's th1e commission: read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
HORATIO 
I beseec1h you.
HAMLET 
Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
Ere I could make a prologue to my bra1ins,
They had begun the play--I sat me down,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
I once did 1hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
How to forget that learnin2g, but, sir, now
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
The effect of what I wrote?
H learnin3ORATIO 
Ay, good my lord.
HAMLET 
An earnest conjuration from the king,
As England was his faith1ful tributary,
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
As peace should stiff her wheate1n garland wear
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,1
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
Without debatement further, more or less,
He sho1uld the bearers put to sudden death,
Not shriving-time allow'd.
HORATIO 
How was this seal'd?
HA1MLET 
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
Which was the 1model of that Danish seal;
Folded the writ up in form of the other,
Subscribed it, gave't the impr1ession, placed it safely,
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
Was our sea-fight; and wha1t to this was sequent
Thou know'st already.
HORATIO 
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
HA1MLET 
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
They are not near my conscience; their defe1at
Does by their own insinuation grow:
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pas1s and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites.
HORATIO 
Why, what a king is this!
HAMLET 
Does1 it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
Popp1'd in between the election and my hopes,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
And with such co1zenage--is't not perfect conscience,
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
To let 1this canker of our nature come
In further evil?
HORATIO 
It must be shortly known to him from Eng1land
What is the issue of the business there.
HAMLET 
It will be short: the interim is mine;
And1 a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I fo1rgot myself;
For, by the image of my cause, I see
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.1
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a towering passion.
HORATIO 
Peace! who come1s here?
Enter OSRIC
OSRIC 
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
HAMLET 
I humbly tha1nk you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
HORATIO 
No, my good lord.
HAMLET 
Thy state is the more 1gracious; for 'tis a vice to
know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
beast be lord of beas1ts, and his crib shall stand at
the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
spacious in the pos1session of dirt.
OSRIC 
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
should impart a thing to 1you from his majesty.
HAMLET 
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
spirit. Put your bonn1et to his right use; 'tis for the head.
OSRIC 
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
HAMLET 
No1, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
northerly.
OSRIC 
It is indifferent cold, my lord, inde1ed.
HAMLET 
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
OSRIC 
Exceedingly, m1y lord; it is very sultry,--as
'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
majesty bade me signi1fy to you that he has laid a
great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
HAMLET 
I besee1ch you, remember--
HAMLET moves him to put on his hat
OSRIC 
Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in1 good faith.
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
me, an absolute gentleman, full of 1most excellent
differences, of very soft society and great showing:
indeed, to speak feelingly of 1him, he is the card or
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a 1gentleman would see.
HAMLET 
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
though, I know, to 1divide him inventorially would
dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
neither, in respect1 of his quick sail. But, in the
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great article; and1 his infusion of such dearth and
rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
semblable is his m1irror; and who else would trace
him, his umbrage, nothing more.
OSRIC 
Your lordship speaks most 1infallibly of him.
HAMLET 
The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer b1reath?
OSRIC 
Sir?
HORATIO 
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
You will do't, s1ir, really.
HAMLET 
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
OSRIC 
Of Laertes?
HORATIO 1
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
HAMLET 
Of him, sir.
OSRIC 
I know yo1u are not ignorant--
HAMLET 
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
it would not much a1pprove me. Well, sir?
OSRIC 
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
HAMLET 
I dare1 not confess that, lest I should compare with
him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
1know himself.
OSRIC 
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
laid on him by them, in h1is meed he's unfellowed.
HAMLET 
What's his weapon?
OSRIC 
Rapier and dagger.
HAMLET 
That's t1wo of his weapons: but, well.
OSRIC 
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
horses: aga1inst the which he has imponed, as I take
it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
assigns, 1as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
respons1ive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
and of very liberal conceit.
HAMLET 
What call you the1 carriages?
HORATIO 
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
OSRIC 
The carr1iages, sir, are the hangers.
HAMLET 
The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
could c1arry cannon by our sides: I would it might
be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
again1st six French swords, their assigns, and three
liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
1against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
OSRIC 
The king, sir, hath laid, that i1n a dozen passes
between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
three hits: he hath laid on twe1lve for nine; and it
would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer.
1HAMLET 
How if I answer 'no'?
OSRIC 
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
HA1MLET 
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day 1with me; let
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
king hold his purpose, I will wi1n for him an I can;
if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
OSRIC 
Shall I re-1deliver you e'en so?
HAMLET 
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
OSRIC 
I1 commend my duty to your lordship.
HAMLET 
Yours, yours.
Exit OSRIC
He does well to commend it h1imself; there are no
tongues else for's turn.
HORATIO 
This lapwing runs away with the shell on h1is head.
HAMLET 
He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
Thus has he--and many more of t1he same bevy that I
know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
the time and outward habit 1of encounter; a kind of
yesty collection, which carries them through and
through the most fond and1 winnowed opinions; and do
but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
Enter a Lord
Lord 1
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend h1im in
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with Laertes, or that you will take1 longer time.
HAMLET 
I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
pleasure: if his fitnes1s speaks, mine is ready; now
or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
Lord 
The king and quee1n and all are coming down.
HAMLET 
In happy time.
Lord 
The queen desires you to use some gentle1
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
HAMLET 
She well instructs me.
Exit Lord
HOR1ATIO 
You will lose this wager, my lord.
HAMLET 
I do not think so: since he went into France, I1
have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's1 here
about my heart: but it is no matter.
HORATIO 
Nay, good my lord,--
HAMLET 
It is but fool1ery; but it is such a kind of
gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
HORATIO 
If your min2d dislike any thing, obey it: I will
forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
fiyour min3t.
HAMLET 
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If 1it be now,
'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
now; if it be not now, yet it will c1ome: the
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
1Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & c
KING CLA1UDIUS 
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLE1T's
HAMLET 
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.1
This presence knows,
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
With sore distraction. What1 I have done,
That might your nature, honour and exception
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madn1ess.
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
And when h1e's not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then? 1His madness: if't be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
His madness is poor Hamlet's en1emy.
Sir, in this audience,
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most g1enerous thoughts,
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
And hurt my brother.
LAERTES 
I am1 satisfied in nature,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
To my revenge: but in my ter1ms of honour
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder masters, of known honour1,
I have a voice and precedent of peace,
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
I do receiv1e your offer'd love like love,
And will not wrong it.
HAMLET 
I embrace it freely;
And will this1 brother's wager frankly play.
Give us the foils. Come on.
LAERTES 
Come, one for me.
HAMLET 
I1'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
S1tick fiery off indeed.
LAERTES 
You mock me, sir.
HAMLET 
No, by this hand.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Giv1e them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
You know the wager?
HAMLET 
Very well, my lord
You1r grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
KING CLAUDIUS 
I do not fear it; I have seen you bo1th:
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
LAERTES 
This is too heavy, let me see anot1her.
HAMLET 
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
They prepare to play
OSRIC 
Ay,1 my good lord.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first1 or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fi1re:
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Riche1r than that which four successive kings
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
And let th1e kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, t1he heavens to earth,
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
And you, the judges, bear a wary1 eye.
HAMLET 
Come on, sir.
LAERTES 
Come, my lord.
They play
HAMLET 
One.
LAERTES 
No.
HA1MLET 
Judgment.
OSRIC 
A hit, a very palpable hit.
LAERTES 
Well; again.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Stay;1 give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Here's to thy health.
Trumpets sound, and cannon shot1 off within
Give him the cup.
HAMLET 
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
They pl1ay
Another hit; what say you?
LAERTES 
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
KING CLAUDIUS 
Our son s1hall win.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy br1ows;
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
HAMLET 
Good madam!
KING CLAUDIUS 
Gertrude, do1 not drink.
QUEEN GERTRUDE 
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
KING CLAUDIUS 
[Aside] It is1 the poison'd cup: it is too late.
HAMLET 
I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
QUEEN GERTRUDE1 
Come, let me wipe thy face.
LAERTES 
My lord, I'll hit him now.
KING CLAUDIUS 
I do not think1't.
LAERTES 
[Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
HAMLET 
Come, for the third, Lae1rtes: you but dally;
I pray you, pass with your best violence;
I am afeard you make a wanton of me1.
LAERTES 
Say you so? come on.
They play
OSRIC 
Nothing, neither way.
LAERTES 
Have at you n1ow!
LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES
KING 1CLAUDIUS 
Part them; they are incensed.
HAMLET 
Nay, come, again.
QUEEN GERTRUDE falls
OSRIC 
1Look to the queen there, ho!
HORATIO 
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
OSRIC 
How i1s't, Laertes?
LAERTES 
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
I am justly kill'd with min1e own treachery.
HAMLET 
How does the queen?
KING CLAUDIUS 
She swounds to see them bleed.
QUEE1N GERTRUDE 
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd1.
Dies
HAMLET 
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
Treachery! Seek it out.
LAERTES 
It is h1ere, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
In thee there is n1ot half an hour of life;
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenom'd: the fou1l practise
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
I1 can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
HAMLET 
The point!--envenom'd too!
Then, venom, to t1hy work.
Stabs KING CLAUDIUS
All 
Treason! treason!
KING CLAUDIUS 
O, yet defend me, friends; I1 am but hurt.
HAMLET 
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Drink off this potion. Is th1y union here?
Follow my mother.
KING CLAUDIUS dies
LAERTES 
He is justly served;
It is a poison1 temper'd by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
Mine and my father's death come 1not upon thee,
Nor thine on me.
Dies
HAMLET 
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
I am d1ead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
That are but m1utes or audience to this act,
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
Is strict in his arres1t--O, I could tell you--
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
Thou livest; report me and my cause ar1ight
To the unsatisfied.
HORATIO 
Never believe it:
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
Her1e's yet some liquor left.
HAMLET 
As thou'rt a man,
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have1't.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If t1hou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw1 thy breath in pain,
To tell my story.
March afar off, and shot within
What warlike noise is this1?
OSRIC 
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
To the ambassadors of England gives
T1his warlike volley.
HAMLET 
O, I die, Horatio;
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
I c1annot live to hear the news from England;
But I do prophesy the election lights
On Fortinbras: he 1has my dying voice;
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
Which have solicited. The res1t is silence.
Dies
HORATIO 
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
And flights of an1gels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?
March within
Enter FORTINBRAS, the Eng1lish Ambassadors, and others
PRINCE FORTINBRAS 
Where is this sight?
HORATIO 
What is it ye woul1d see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS 
This quarry cries on havo1c. O proud death,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
That thou so many princes at a shot1
So bloodily hast struck?
First Ambassador 
The sight is dismal;
And our affairs from England com1e too late:
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
To tell him his commandment is ful1fill'd,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
Where should we have our thanks?
HORATIO 
No1t from his mouth,
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
He never gave commandment for their dea1th.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,2
Are here arrived give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view;
And ngland,3let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about: so shall you hear
Of carnal,b
